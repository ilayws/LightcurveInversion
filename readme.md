A project aiming to reconstruct and identify 3D asteroid shapes only from their lightcurve graphs. Implements a simple raytracing algorithm and a neural network.

shape_generator.py : 
Generates convex/nonconvex shapes.

ray_tracer.py :
Generates lightcurve data for .obj meshes.

display_lightcurve.py :
Display a lightcurve from the data generated.

neural_network.py : 
Train and test the NN on the data generated.

gpu.txt :
C code for the gpu raytracing.
